Our Motive
Our Motive relies in helping others specically in the area of IT. 

In Web Development, specically we do not use CMS, we build the project from group up using HTML CSS (CSS Frameworks & Libs), JS (JS Frameworks & Libs). so that we can provide as much customization as we can. 

One of our important motive is to give our services at as low cost as possible, and therefore we try to utilize the Open-Source Softwares and Solution, we utilize the online freely available resources of our projects (taking care that we do not voilate any copyrights or licenses).
We try to develop mostly from the free resources and hence reduce the overall cost of the project.
